This repository contains a Tcl script demonstrating an incorrect usage of the expr command that causes unexpected calculation results.  The bug is due to the lack of proper handling of variable expansion and the expr command expecting expressions instead of variable names.

The solution demonstrates a corrected implementation of the procedure, resulting in the expected calculation outcome.
